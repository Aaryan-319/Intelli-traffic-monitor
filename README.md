This project is a Traffic Violation Detection System that uses YOLOv8 for object detection and number plate recognition. It monitors traffic, detects violations such as speeding, and provides a web-based interface for viewing detected violations.

Features
	•	Vehicle Detection: Identifies vehicles on the road using YOLOv8.
	•	Speed Violation Detection: Measures vehicle speed and detects overspeeding.
	•	Unique Rider ID: Assigns a unique ID to each detected vehicle.
	•	Number Plate Recognition: Extracts vehicle license plates for identification.
	•	Web Dashboard: Displays real-time violations and traffic data.
	•	Backend API: Processes detections and serves data to the frontend.
